Super Rainbow Reef was created using IntelliJ IDEA with the version 12 of Java. 
The current working directory is the Desktop directory on my laptop. The JAR file can run by clicking it or just running through terminal.

The controls of this game is:
A - Move Katch Left
D - Move Right

You have to start right away after running the jar, there is a bug that ends making the game play differently. Katch will start moving at a bigger pace than it supposed to be.


## src folder is to be used to store source code only.

## resources folder is to be used to store the resources for your project only. This includes images, sounds, map text files, etc.

## jar folder is used to store the built jar of your term-project. NO SOURCE CODE SHOULD BE IN THIS FOLDER. DOING SO WILL CAUSE POINTS TO BE DEDUCTED
